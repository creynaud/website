			<h2 class="margin">About me</h2>
			<p>Hi, my name is Claire. This is my personal website. I am a mobile and cloud software engineer with 8 years experience.
			Above all I like to build software that brings value to its users. I am also a big fan of Lean Start-up and Agile methodologies like Scrum.
			I have been working for startups (Trango Virtual Processors, acquired by VMware) as well as big companies (VMware, Yahoo).
			I am currently working for <a href="http://www.epyx.ch/">Epyx</a> in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
			<h2 class="margin">Personal projects</h2>
			<p>Right now, I am building an iOS localization service called <a href="https://www.babelbytes.com">BabelBytes</a>.</p>
			<br><p>On BabelBytes, iOS app developers can get their app translated by native speakers.</p>
			<br><p>This project is keeping me up at night for several reasons:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>1. I have been tearing my hair out trying to get apps translated for too long.</li>
			<li>2. I am very interested in experimenting on the Minimal Viable Product concept, from the Lean start-up methodology</li>
			<li>3. I wanted to try out a cloud PAAS provider with a real project (BabelBytes is running on Heroku. It also uses Amazon S3 for file storage.)</li>
			<li>4. I needed to improve my web development skills, because in my opinion such skills are now mandatory for a mobile developer</li>
			</ul>
